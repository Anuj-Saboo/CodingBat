#Given an array of ints length 3, return a new array with the elements in reverse order, so {1, 2, 3} becomes {3, 2, 1}.

#reverse3([1, 2, 3]) → [3, 2, 1]
#reverse3([5, 11, 9]) → [9, 11, 5]
#reverse3([7, 0, 0]) → [0, 0, 7]


def reverse3(nums):
  return nums[2::-1]   
  
  #return nums[::-1] Alternate Method 1
  
  #nums.reverse() Alternate Method 2. Note that this reverses the list nums and doesnt return anything. The original list is reversed.
  #return nums
